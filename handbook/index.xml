This radar is how we assess and adopt new technology. Throughout the years, we observe the tech industry and pick out the most promising tech to put into the radar to begin the assessment process.
Our tech radar is highly motivated by ThoughtWork’s vision of the technology radar, which is a visual document of industry changes we find interesting as well as of what tech we have trialed and adopted in our company.</description></item><item><title>Sharing</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/learning/sharing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/learning/sharing/</guid><description>Sharing At Dwarves Foundation, we believe that sharing is an important part of our culture. We share almost everything: every week, a lot of events are open to the public, and some of them are recorded so that anyone can watch the videos to learn. It may seem strange to share so much, but there are good reasons for it.
The goal of what is shared at Dwarves is not just to make more people learn new technology or knowledge, but to improve the ability of the presenter to communicate their understanding, which will in turn improve their ability to create new things.</description></item><item><title>Showcase</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/learning/showcase/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/learning/showcase/</guid><description>Showcase Every Friday afternoon, everyone in the company is invited to gather on Discord for internal demos of projects teams have been working on. This tradition was founded by Engineering, but anyone (from Design, Product,&amp;hellip;) is welcome to participate.
We value the importance of sharing our work with other people at Dwarves. We hold demos and celebrate our craftsmanship, insight, and learning with others. And it&amp;rsquo;s a chance for people who don&amp;rsquo;t work directly on development to feel included in the process.</description></item><item><title>Engineering Ladder</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/engineering-ladder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/engineering-ladder/</guid><description>Engineering Ladder One of the biggest challenges in people management is determining whether your engineers are growing in their careers. While large companies have established career ladders, most companies sacrifice them to stay “flatter” and “more agile”. In reality, there’s no such thing as a “flat” organization—having one means that people don’t spend time talking about or thinking about levels and promotions because there are so many other things to do.</description></item><item><title>One on one meeting</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/one-on-one-meeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/one-on-one-meeting/</guid><description>1 on 1 Our culture is founded upon the strong relationships between people. One-on-one meetings are the way to establish these relationships. Every manager has a 1-1 with each of their direct reports once a week, or whenever convenient for both parties involved. This page will take you through how we conduct a one-on-one at Dwarves Foundation as well as some tips to keep the meeting productive.
The first meeting The first one-on-one meeting is your chance to set a pattern and standard of how you and your manager feel good about the future and how you two want to interact.</description></item><item><title>Continuing Education Allowance</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/guides/continuing-education-allowance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/guides/continuing-education-allowance/</guid><description>Continuing Education Allowance You will always grow by learning and playing with new and cool technologies.

We work in an 8-week cycle at Dwarves Foundation. There are typically six cycles to a year. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning and provide a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.</description></item><item><title>Purpose</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/purpose/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/purpose/</guid><description>Where we are heading We start with purpose. The mankind is here today because of 4 billion years of continuous evolution from a single cell to homo sapiens, through the stone age to bronze, iron, medieval to post-classical and renaissance. The nations and our civilization were built on production, on building.
Every time we look back at what we are as a race; in the beginning, we feel motivated by what the ancestors have done.</description></item><item><title>Making a Career</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/making-a-career/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/making-a-career/</guid><description>Making a Career The average tenure of employees working at many technology companies today is shockingly low. At both Amazon, Google and other companies, it’s just around one year. At Dwarves Foundation, it’s just around three years as of late 2018. That’s something to be proud of, and something to ensure endures. When you work at Dwarves Foundation, it should be feasible to think about this as the place for making a life-long career.</description></item><item><title>Email Communication and Use</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/guides/email-communication-and-uses/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/handbook/guides/email-communication-and-uses/</guid><description>Email Communication and Use We use email as our formal tool for both internal and external communication.
