It has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to provide a native-like experience while reducing development time and cost.
Introduction At Dwarves, React Native has been on our radar and we use it in some of our projects. Lately, we have been investigating cost-benefits of using it and making light of some concerns we should be aware of.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Translation</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/continuous-translation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/continuous-translation/</guid><description>Introduction Continuous Translation (CT) is a modern approach to translation management that involves synchronizing software development and translation workflows. This means that developers, translators, and product owners work together in a continuous cycle to ensure that all translations are up-to-date and aligned with the latest software developments.
Unlike traditional translation workflows, Continuous Translation eliminates the need for file and space synchronization between different stakeholders, streamlining the translation process and promoting better collaboration.</description></item><item><title>What Is Pnpm Compare To Npmyarn</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/what-is-pnpm-compare-to-npmyarn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/what-is-pnpm-compare-to-npmyarn/</guid><description>What is PNPM? At Dwarves Foundation, we are always on the lookout for new tech. Researching PNPM was originally from research on what package manager Next.js uses. We then tried to experiment with it for dwarves/react-toolkit, which has given us some insights into some of the cost-benefits of using the package manager.
Introduction PNPM is a package manager for Node.js which stands for “Performant NPM”. It was introduced in 2016, the same year Yarn was released.</description></item><item><title>A Case Study Interview Into Micro Frontends Building Design System For E Commerce Platform</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/a-case-study-interview-into-micro-frontends-building-design-system-for-e-commerce-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/a-case-study-interview-into-micro-frontends-building-design-system-for-e-commerce-platform/</guid><description>A Case Study Interview into Micro-Frontends: Building Design System for E-commerce Platform Previously on Why Micro-Frontend, we took a look into what is Micro-Frontend architecture, as well as some core concepts behind it. For some of you that have missed the memo, here’s a tl;dr:
Micro frontend architecture is an approach to building web applications by splitting the user interface into smaller, independent, and reusable parts. Each part is owned and developed by a separate team, and they are brought together in the browser to create a single, seamless user experience.</description></item><item><title>I18n Frontend Guideline</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/i18n-frontend-guideline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/i18n-frontend-guideline/</guid><description>In a front-end web application, locales are used to determine the language and geographic location of the user and to display the appropriate content to them.
When a user visits a web page, the application will first detect their locale, then use this information to determine which version of the content to display.
To support multiple languages and locales, the application needs to have the necessary content available for each locale.</description></item><item><title>Radio Talk 61 Monorepo</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/radio-talk-61-monorepo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/radio-talk-61-monorepo/</guid><description>Demystifying Monorepos: A Recap of Our Recent Sharing Session During our recent sharing session, we delved into the world of monorepos, exploring their benefits, challenges, and the tools available to manage them effectively.
