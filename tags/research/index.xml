It&amp;rsquo;s all around us. Our every movement, every click, is tracked and measured; we quantify the quality of our sleep, how much exercise we get, and how much time we spend looking at our phones.</description></item><item><title>Democratize user research to scale user research</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/democratize-user-research-to-scale-user-research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/democratize-user-research-to-scale-user-research/</guid><description>Large organizations&amp;rsquo; demand for research can outstrip capacity. Unless research is able to scale in response, it&amp;rsquo;s possible for it to become a bottleneck for design and development.</description></item><item><title>Good research starts with a good question</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/good-research-starts-with-a-good-question/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/good-research-starts-with-a-good-question/</guid><description>The question doesn&amp;rsquo;t need necessarily to be precise; as Erika Hall puts it, an early question might be &amp;ldquo;We need to understand what other people think about x.</description></item><item><title>How many users should you interview</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/how-many-users-should-you-interview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/how-many-users-should-you-interview/</guid><description>The number of interviews of participants you might need to engage with in a round of qualitative interviews to achieve data saturation can be difficult to estimate.</description></item><item><title>Landscape of UX research methods</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/landscape-of-ux-research-methods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/landscape-of-ux-research-methods/</guid><description>UX research methods can be organized according to a 3-dimensional framework with the following axes:
Attitudinal vs behavioural Qualitative vs quantitative Context of use Attitudinal vs behavioural Attitudinal research uncovers what people say, or their stated beliefs; behavioural research uncovers what people actually do.</description></item><item><title>Lean methodologies promote velocity at the expense of understanding</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/lean-methodologies-promote-velocity-at-the-expense-of-understanding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/lean-methodologies-promote-velocity-at-the-expense-of-understanding/</guid><description>Design and product development methodologies like Lean are biased toward delivery. They&amp;rsquo;re intended to limit waste and drive efficiency through &amp;ldquo;just in time&amp;rdquo; delivery of minimum viable solutions.</description></item><item><title>Prototypes help test ideas that are already refined</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/prototypes-help-test-ideas-that-are-already-refined/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/prototypes-help-test-ideas-that-are-already-refined/</guid><description>In design, it can be tempting to rush to develop a prototype to get &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; feedback on an idea. Erika Hall posits that this is because a prototype, no matter how low fidelity, feels tangible: it provides physical, concrete evidence of progress.</description></item><item><title>Research repositories should generate new knowledge</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/research-repositories-should-generate-new-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/research-repositories-should-generate-new-knowledge/</guid><description>A research repository that simply accumulates insights is only doing half its job. An effective repository facilitates the productive combination of knowledge to generate new ideas and insights that might have been inaccessible until disparate observations were put into conversation with one another.</description></item><item><title>Skeuomorphism</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/skeuomorphism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/skeuomorphism/</guid><description>Skeuomorphism describes the creation of an object or design that contains elements that hearken back to attributes or structures of some other material or technique.</description></item><item><title>Skeuoumorphic models limit possibilities for innovation</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/skeuoumorphic-models-limit-possibilities-for-innovation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/skeuoumorphic-models-limit-possibilities-for-innovation/</guid><description>Skeuomorphism in design describes the rendering of digital items in terms of their real-life counterparts. For example, skeuomorphic design might render a notebook application such that it resembles a physical notebook.</description></item><item><title>Spend more time in the problem space</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/spend-more-time-in-the-problem-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/spend-more-time-in-the-problem-space/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to rush to an answer. As Christian Madsbjerg has argued, we seem to want as a culture to turn creativity into an assembly line: we input problems, we output answers, all through some standardized process.</description></item><item><title>Test digital experiences longitudinally</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/test-digital-experiences-longitudinally/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/test-digital-experiences-longitudinally/</guid><description>A user&amp;rsquo;s perception of an experience is not static. It can change over time. What upon first encounter seemed innovative or delightful can become familiar or even frustrating over time with repeated usage.</description></item><item><title>Users perception of frequently used applications declines over time</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/users-perception-of-frequently-used-applications-declines-over-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/users-perception-of-frequently-used-applications-declines-over-time/</guid><description>Over time, a user&amp;rsquo;s perception of a frequently used tool or application will decline if the application itself remains static.

While ux researchers are generally less concerned with sample size than quantitative researchers, they should be mindful of strength of evidence.</description></item></channel></rss>
