After careful evaluation, we found that pnpm is widely embraced by the development community and has been successfully used by great teams at Vercel, Nx, and Chakra UI.
Previously, we were using Yarn V1 classic, but as our projects grew, we faced challenges with disk space and slow installations.</description></item><item><title>Beyond The Title</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/beyond-the-title/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/beyond-the-title/</guid><description>The Common Dilemma You&amp;rsquo;re only paid that much to do that much We only pay you that much if you can do only that much It&amp;rsquo;s the scenario that people measure and expect their effort should be traded into paychecks.

This method has been my sweet escape for the past 4 years, get-away from the chaotic pop-ups, notifications, messages, deadlines from work and normal life, to find the right balance for my energy and my mind as well.

Based on the Quality Software Management book of Gerald Weinberg, the resource context switching cost is shown as below:
The column &amp;ldquo;Loss to Context Switching&amp;rdquo; is a total loss for your productivity. Therefore, one person should only be assigned to maximum 3 projects at the same time, and the total working hour of that person should NOT exceed 120% (meaning not more than 12 hours per day).</description></item></channel></rss>
