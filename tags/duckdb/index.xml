We are excited to announce that we have updated our Forward Engineering to better reflect the feedback and insights from our Labs team, Operations Team, and Consulting Team.
This is to hopefully provide you with a more comprehensive publication that not only keeps you informed about the latest technologies and where they are applied, but also foster collaboration and innovation within our organization.</description></item><item><title>DuckDB demo and showcase</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/labs/events/duckdb-demo-and-showcase/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/labs/events/duckdb-demo-and-showcase/</guid><description>Event Date Discord Channel Type 23/11/2023 ðŸŽ™ãƒ»labs-stage Internal DuckDB has been an emerging OLAP database for analytical needs. Use cases for analytics usually use around 1GB-10GB of data, not enough to take advantage of the full potential of databases in data warehouses.

Agenda: DuckDB is a great starting point for modern stacks that don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about scalability, but want to derive hard analytics from the data that they have.</description></item><item><title>October Forward Engineering 2023</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/forward-engineering-october-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/forward-engineering-october-2023/</guid><description>As we step into the exciting opportunities of October, we are at a crucial point in the ever-changing world of technology. Our adventure until now has been for the most part very exciting, with a strong focus on &amp;lsquo;Full-stack engineeringâ€™ Now, we shift our attention to a topic that is prolific and always true: Open-source.
Open-source has always been the foundation for many hobby projects, learning experiences, startups, and enterprises. It has stayed true to the idea for the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose - originally helping to fix bugs and later accelerating state-of-the-art tech and AI.</description></item></channel></rss>
