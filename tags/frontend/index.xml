For some of you that have missed the memo, hereâ€™s a tl;dr:
Micro frontend architecture is an approach to building web applications by splitting the user interface into smaller, independent, and reusable parts. Each part is owned and developed by a separate team, and they are brought together in the browser to create a single, seamless user experience.</description></item><item><title>Accelerate Project Initiation With Advanced Nextjs Boilerplate React Toolkit</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/accelerate-project-initiation-with-advanced-nextjs-boilerplate-react-toolkit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/accelerate-project-initiation-with-advanced-nextjs-boilerplate-react-toolkit/</guid><description>Accelerate Project Initiation with Advanced NextJS-Boilerplate &amp;amp; React-Toolkit In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced world of software development, project initiation can often be a challenging and time-consuming process, with teams facing issues such as inconsistent code quality, slow setup times, and suboptimal workflows. To address these obstacles and streamline the project initiation process, we&amp;rsquo;ve developed two powerful libraries, NextJS-Boilerplate and React-Toolkit, that can help teams get started quickly and efficiently.

When a user visits a web page, the application will first detect their locale, then use this information to determine which version of the content to display.
To support multiple languages and locales, the application needs to have the necessary content available for each locale.</description></item><item><title>React Native New Architecture</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/react-native-new-architecture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/react-native-new-architecture/</guid><description>ðŸ“– Introducing react-native&amp;rsquo;s new architecture changes that boost performance, bringing react-native back into the race with Flutter
Introduction of react-native ðŸ“± React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing high-performance mobile apps that leverage iOS and Android native components. It is based on React, and is very accessible to React Web developers
After a long announcement, planned from 2018, appeared in 2020, merged in 2021 and officially published in April 2022, react-native has a new architecture that improves performance dramatically.</description></item><item><title>React 18</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/react-18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/react-18/</guid><description>React 18 was released in March 2022. This release focuses on performance improvements and updating the rendering engine.
React 18 Feature Quick Guide Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at each of these updates in more detail.
Concurrency in React Concurrency is not a feature, per se. Itâ€™s a new behind-the-scenes mechanism that enables React to prepare multiple versions of your UI at the same time. A key property of Concurrent React is that rendering is interruptible.</description></item><item><title>Remix Versus Nextjs</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/remix-versus-nextjs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/remix-versus-nextjs/</guid><description>ðŸ“– A brief comparison between Remix and Next.js frameworks
Introduction of Remix Remix describes itself as:
Remix is an edge native, full-stack JavaScript framework for building modern, fast, and resilient user experiences. It unifies the client and server with web standards so you can think less about code and more about your product.
Compared to Next.js, which is one of the most React frameworks used for server-side rendering and has been there for a significant time, Remix appears as a new strong competitor.</description></item><item><title>Jotai</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/radar/jotai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/radar/jotai/</guid><description>Description Jotai takes an atomic approach to global React state management with a model inspired by Recoil.
Whatâ€™s better about this method or library Build state by combining atoms and renders are automatically optimized based on atom dependency. This solves the extra re-render issue of React context and eliminates the need for memoization.
It scales from a simple useState replacement to an enterprise TypeScript application with complex requirements. Plus there are plenty of utilities and integrations to help you along the way!</description></item><item><title>Remix</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/radar/remix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/radar/remix/</guid><description>Description Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience.

Has a comfy API based on hooks, isn&amp;rsquo;t boilerplatey or opinionated.
Whatâ€™s better about this method or library Itâ€™s one of the smallest state management library. Itâ€™s 100 percent unopinionated. Itâ€™s not only for React. For example, we can combine the state of different applications no matter what framework they use (micro frontends). It can deal with common pitfalls, like the dreaded zombie child problem, react concurrency, and context loss.</description></item></channel></rss>
