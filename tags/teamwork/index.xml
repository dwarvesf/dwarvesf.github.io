We believe that growth is our universal language, and we&amp;rsquo;re always striving to improve ourselves, both personally and professionally. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a job for us; it&amp;rsquo;s a way of life. We&amp;rsquo;re hustlers with an extra hat, always pushing ourselves to be better and earn more.
Every time we hire, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for like-minded individuals who share our growth mindset. We want to be with people who are willing to challenge themselves and reach new heights.</description></item><item><title>Red Flags</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/red-flags/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/red-flags/</guid><description>These red flags are things we don’t want to see in our peeps.
