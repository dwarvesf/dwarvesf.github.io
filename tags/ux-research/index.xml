However, changes generally gestate over long periods of time. In the beginning, there may be weak signals of change.</description></item><item><title>Falsifiability</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/falsifiability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/falsifiability/</guid><description>Faslifiability describes the capacity of a statement to be proven false. For example, the presence of a black swan falsifies the statement &amp;ldquo;All swans are white.</description></item><item><title>Inductive reasoning</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/inductive-reasoning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/inductive-reasoning/</guid><description>Cedric Chin associates inductive reasoning with creativity. In contrast to deduction, which looks to apply an existing mental model to data, inductive reasoning requires the observation and processing of raw observation into a new mental model—of linking together disparate threads into a new perspective.</description></item><item><title>Measuring behaviour changes behaviour</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/measuring-behaviour-changes-behaviour/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/measuring-behaviour-changes-behaviour/</guid><description>Measuring behaviour will provoke change in that behaviour. Something akin to the observer effect takes place: we adjust our behaviour to be &amp;ldquo;seen&amp;rdquo; by the measures.</description></item><item><title>Mixed Methods</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/mixed-methods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/mixed-methods/</guid><description>Summary Ladner outlines the different strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research methods, providing a framework for leveraging the strengths of each approach.</description></item><item><title>Qualitative and quantitative research methods each have trade-offs</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-and-quantitative-research-methods-each-have-trade-offs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-and-quantitative-research-methods-each-have-trade-offs/</guid><description>There are trade-offs between quantitative and qualitative methods; quant methods offer scale and focus on causation, but sacrifice coherence and focus.</description></item><item><title>Qualitative and quantitative research represent different philosophies of knowledge</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-and-quantitative-research-represent-different-philosophies-of-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-and-quantitative-research-represent-different-philosophies-of-knowledge/</guid><description>The difference between qualitative and quantitative research is more than the kinds or amount of data they work with.
Quantitative research, Sam Ladner writes, &amp;ldquo;begins with the assumption that reality is a stable, objective thing,&amp;rdquo; whereas qualitative researches view meaning as subjective.</description></item><item><title>Qualitative research creates mental models about the problem space</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-research-creates-mental-models-about-the-problem-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-research-creates-mental-models-about-the-problem-space/</guid><description>Qualitative research helps us build mental models about the contexts, problems, and motivations our products and designs must account for. It helps us understand what is important at a high level—what matters to people and how they understand their relationship to the world.</description></item><item><title>Qualitative research excels at explanation</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-research-excels-at-explanation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-research-excels-at-explanation/</guid><description>Qualitative researchers can explain causation through metaphor, narratives, and thought experiments; these can in turn generate explanatory concepts that may be tested with quantitative methodologies.</description></item><item><title>Qualitative researchers care more about data saturation than sample size</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-researchers-care-more-about-data-saturation-than-sample-size/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/qualitative-researchers-care-more-about-data-saturation-than-sample-size/</guid><description>Qualitative research is less concerned with reaching a particular sample size. Its focus isn&amp;rsquo;t on measuring scale, but on discovering high-level problems and mental models.</description></item><item><title>Quant data is lossy</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/quant-data-is-lossy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/quant-data-is-lossy/</guid><description>Reducing human activity to numbers involves a kind of compression, and a particularly lossy one at that. Simply, there aspects of human activity that do not translate well into scorecards or dashboards; when we reduce those activities to a quantitative measure, we sacrifice rich contextual data.</description></item><item><title>Quantitative analysis is not inherently more reliable than qualitative data</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/quantitative-analysis-is-not-inherently-more-reliable-than-qualitative-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/mixed-methods/quantitative-analysis-is-not-inherently-more-reliable-than-qualitative-data/</guid><description>It’s naive to assume that quantitative analysis is inherently a more reliable or scientific than human judgment. Quantitative data, too, is the product of bias.</description></item><item><title>Sensemaking</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/sensemaking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/sensemaking/</guid><description>Summary Madsbjerg argues that our culture—especially in the business world—has become to taken with a bias toward scientific or algorithmic thinking.</description></item></channel></rss>
