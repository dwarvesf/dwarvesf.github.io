This migration led to numerous benefits, including a 60% reduction in build times, a 40% increase in developer productivity, and simplified dependency management. Our goal is to offer valuable insights and lessons learned throughout our journey to help others considering a similar transition.

How do you feel? Do you see that it is similar to an owl face? The answer to this phenomenon is called Isomorphism which is part of the 12 Gestalt rules.

Vertical spacing Spacing within each paragraph Firstly, I start the simplest content type — paragraph. One of the atoms decides aesthetic design. So you need to focus on them. You commonly depend on default line-height of the font to design the content. I have increased line by 2px to 3px in this way because they are too tight.

In design have four main factors in such as:
