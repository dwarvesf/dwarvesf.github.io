With more recent concerns on privacy and security, we wanted to understand how we could move tokens across blockchains without needing to know any other information about the transaction. This has motivated our research on Zero-Knowledge proofs and their possible applications for bridges.
Introduction Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we think about trust and decentralization, enabling the creation of secure and transparent systems without the need for intermediaries.</description></item><item><title>Spike Inu Engineering A Seamless Experience For Cross Chain Swap And Decentralized Exchange</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/spike-inu-engineering-a-seamless-experience-for-cross-chain-swap-and-decentralized-exchange/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/spike-inu-engineering-a-seamless-experience-for-cross-chain-swap-and-decentralized-exchange/</guid><description>In brief When blockchain becomes the new tech blockbuster, worldwide blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, or Binance Smart Chance started to develop their own tokens. They all possess the same vision: Empower crypto users to transfer their assets in multiple chains hassle-free and effective. The core engine of those products is building a secured bridging solution between chains, enabling tokens to move back and forth, and transferring tokens on the same network.</description></item><item><title>Hedge Foundation A Customized All In One Trading Platform For Pro Traders</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/hedge-foundation-a-customized-all-in-one-trading-platform-for-pro-traders/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/hedge-foundation-a-customized-all-in-one-trading-platform-for-pro-traders/</guid><description>In brief Hedge Foundation is a powerful dashboard to support users in managing crypto account positions, balance, PNL and works on bulk orders for profit and loss tracking.

Blockchain is buzzing with the capability of solving trust issues in not only the technology but also other domains like economies and even government regulators.

The complexity of Blockchain and what it does make users feel confused and suspicious, which builds a huge barrier between users and products.</description></item><item><title>Federated Byzantine</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/federated-byzantine/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/federated-byzantine/</guid><description>Stellar is all about trust (validators). After all, when you have to trust somebody, you&amp;rsquo;d trust the reputated nodes, rather than a random stranger node on the internet.
You can imagine Quorum as a list of validators. Every Stellar node has its chosen validators in its own Quorum. For new nodes (e.g. by domestic users like me), we tend to choose the official/reputated nodes (e.g. nodes at SDF/IBM) to trust / to be the validators in our Quorum.</description></item><item><title>Fabric Hyperledger Architecture Explanation</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/fabric-hyperledger-architecture-explanation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/memo/fabric-hyperledger-architecture-explanation/</guid><description>What is Hyperledger Hyperledger is an open source community focused on developing a suite of stable frameworks, tools and libraries for enterprise-grade blockchain deployments.
