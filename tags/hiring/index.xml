At both Amazon, Google and other companies, it’s just around one year. At Dwarves Foundation, it’s just around three years as of late 2018. That’s something to be proud of, and something to ensure endures. When you work at Dwarves Foundation, it should be feasible to think about this as the place for making a life-long career.</description></item><item><title>What We Stand For</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/hiring/additional-info/what-we-stand-for/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/hiring/additional-info/what-we-stand-for/</guid><description>What we stand for Empower Innovation with Software Craftsmanship Innovation happens.
