Last week, I was taught under the instruction of Khai Le about design thinking and how it works in a design process of a software project. So I decided to write a recap of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.

I&amp;rsquo;m currently part of the Dwarves Foundation team. My intention has always been to become a better problem solver, with creativity and productivity being my main goals and focus.
Being a self-learned designer, I research and read a lot. One of my all-time favorite articles is Design Thinking for everyday life by Amira Budi Mutiara. This piece broadened my perspective about Design Thinking and made me curious about the possibility of using Design Thinking to solve problems in everyday life.</description></item></channel></rss>
