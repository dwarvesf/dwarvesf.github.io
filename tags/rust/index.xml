We are excited to announce that we have updated our Forward Engineering to better reflect the feedback and insights from our Labs team, Operations Team, and Consulting Team.
This is to hopefully provide you with a more comprehensive publication that not only keeps you informed about the latest technologies and where they are applied, but also foster collaboration and innovation within our organization.</description></item><item><title>Implement a rust game through WASM</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/earn/implement-a-rust-game-through-wasm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/earn/implement-a-rust-game-through-wasm/</guid><description> Design a simple game concept suitable for implementation in Rust.

Specifically, the hope is to develop a browser that is more amenable to safe and parallel than the existing ones, while also being less prone to common C++ coding errors.
What makes Rust special Ownership Each value in Rust has a variable that&amp;rsquo;s called its owner, there can only be one owner at a time When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped Variable scope is a range within a program for which an item is valid Let’s take this example:</description></item></channel></rss>
