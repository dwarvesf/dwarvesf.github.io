Starting from scratch, the company has always placed emphasis on being surrounded by individuals who can efficiently ship software and don&amp;rsquo;t waste time on unimportant tasks. These individuals are highly respected and valued within the company, as they play a crucial role in the development and success of projects.</description></item><item><title>Forward Engineering Year 2022</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/forward-engineering-year-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/forward-engineering-year-2022/</guid><description>What is Learning at Dwarves?

We don’t treat team bonding the common way, because we understand our engineers. Most of our engineers don’t want running and getting sweaty on the beach for “team-building” activities, or pretending to smile in front of the travel agent’s camera.
This was our first company get-together after 2 years of COVID. It was organized in ways that we can all look back to the progress we’ve made, pat ourselves on the back, have a blast together, and look forward to an even better 2023.</description></item><item><title>Configure The Company Email</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/configure-the-company-email/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/configure-the-company-email/</guid><description>1.
