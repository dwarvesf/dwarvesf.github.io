Failure to meet these criteria at the end of a sprint normally implies that the work should not be counted toward that sprint&amp;rsquo;s velocity nor released.
Verifying that our team’s DoD meets these criteria will ensure that we are delivering features that are done both in terms of functionality and quality.</description></item><item><title>Estimation In Agile</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/estimation-in-agile/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/estimation-in-agile/</guid><description>Estimation (or estimating) is the process of finding an estimate, or approximation, which is a value that is usable for some purpose even if input data may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable.
The value is nonetheless usable because it is derived from the best information available. [1]
Estimation units In our workflow we use two different units that are explained below.
Story points Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.</description></item><item><title>Sprint Lifecycle</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/sprint-lifecycle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/sprint-lifecycle/</guid><description>Sprint &amp;ldquo;milestones&amp;rdquo; Below listed are the rules for each step of the sprint lifecycle. No exceptions will be made for any of the points.
