Then we moved to the 2nd volume, where we figured ways to simplify the workflow and complete our project toolkit.
And here we go again, another version of tech radar at Dwarves Foundation. 2021 has just gone through its first quarter, and we&amp;rsquo;ve left with some new toys to trial and see if they create any impact.</description></item><item><title>Dwarves Tech Radar Volume 02</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/newsletter/forward/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/newsletter/forward/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-02/</guid><description>Once every month, we gather for Radar update to round up the cool techs and assess if we should adopt that to the team. Road to a wider and more diversified rings, Dwarves Tech Radar v2 contains the practices to simplify the workflow, new techniques/ approach methods to upgrade our current standards, and **expand the domain knowledge. **

Dwarves Tech Radar kicked the initial step since January of 2020.
It is the first time we sit down and do it in written form. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit hard for the engineers at first, but we managed to complete the volume with ten reports.
Besides volume 01, we have an opportunity to sort out our current technology index and put it at https://d.</description></item><item><title>Dwarves Tech Radar The Introduction</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/newsletter/forward/dwarves-tech-radar-the-introduction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/newsletter/forward/dwarves-tech-radar-the-introduction/</guid><description>Our Perspective on Technology Technology is eating the world. The technology we used yesterday may be deprecated today. New technology has enabled us to create new things. With the existing set of problems, new solutions will emerge along with new technologies.
Over five years of working as an innovative software firm, other than the energetic tech-savvy workforce, we shape the team day by day with the core values that move towards the engineering culture.</description></item></channel></rss>
