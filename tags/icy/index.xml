Context:
Back in 2018, when i envisioned doing something unconventional with our setup, we introduced ðŸ’Ž $dfg.
It came with a dream that everyone on the team can help build next generation software, stay cool making money and own something. I planned to step down and give more ownership to those who actually implement our projects by gradually distributing $dfg to our grind chads.</description></item></channel></rss>
