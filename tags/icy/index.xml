Since 2020, $icy has been a part of our workflow. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recap.
2020: we introduced ICY as our first community experiment. 2021: we launched icy.so, a site to redeem $icy. 2022: $icy became our primary reward method, starting with summit-2022 and doty where we sent out about $20000 2023: we introduced vault as a reward avenue for our functional team.</description></item><item><title>üí† df protocol, $icy and $dfg</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/community/df-protocol-icy-dfg/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/community/df-protocol-icy-dfg/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s our draft internal map/v0 for üßä $icy play, based on our current activities at this borderless software firm.

Back in 2018, when i envisioned doing something unconventional with our setup, we introduced üíé $dfg.
It came with a dream that everyone on the team can help build next generation software, stay cool making money and own something. I planned to step down and give more ownership to those who actually implement our projects by gradually distributing $dfg to our grind chads.</description></item></channel></rss>
