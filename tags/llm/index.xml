The system automatically constructs a question set based on the candidate&amp;rsquo;s position, such as fresher, mid-level, or senior, to provide relevant questions based on their expertise.</description></item><item><title>Easy Prompt Engineering For Business Use And Mitigating Risks In Llms</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/easy-prompt-engineering-for-business-use-and-mitigating-risks-in-llms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/easy-prompt-engineering-for-business-use-and-mitigating-risks-in-llms/</guid><description>Preface At Dwarves, we&amp;rsquo;ve begun creating apps with ChatGPT for some of our clients. One common problem we face is what techniques of prompt engineering should we use for cases like avoiding political interactions and defending against data leaks. We have been exposed to jailbreaks for ChatGPT such as DAN and Mango Tom, but only recently have figured out how to engineer these kinds of prompts for our research. There are quite a lot of prompt engineering techniques, but below is a collection of common techniques we think you might need the most when creating business apps.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Machine Learning Approaches For Fine Tuning Llama Models</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/exploring-machine-learning-approaches-for-fine-tuning-llama-models/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/exploring-machine-learning-approaches-for-fine-tuning-llama-models/</guid><description>At Dwarves, we&amp;rsquo;ve been increasingly exposed to more state-of-the-art news coming from AI than ever before, of course, related to Large Language Models (LLM). We&amp;rsquo;ve had a taste of what AI has to offer with Stable Diffusion and more commercial apps, and have been eager to learn and hone our skillsets in applying these new AI breakthroughs in our everyday lives and our apps.
Introduction If 2021 was the year of blockchain, it&amp;rsquo;s probably safe to say that 2023 is the year of generative AI.</description></item></channel></rss>
