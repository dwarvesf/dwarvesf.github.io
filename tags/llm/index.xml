On top of those domains, there has been smaller, but very notable trends on the growth of Software as a Service (SaaS) or MicroSaaS&amp;rsquo; that have created rebound and significant growth on serverless services, as a means to avoid startup and initial running costs. Likewise, AI has been changing how we work and how we design systems to enrich workflows and create more naturally interactive apps.</description></item><item><title>Market Report Jan 2024</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/labs/market-report-jan-2024/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/labs/market-report-jan-2024/</guid><description>Trends on our Radar Here are some of the few trends we are seeing across the industry, in our projects, as well as our community. This market report isn&amp;rsquo;t exhaustive, at least just yet, with certain trends not yet listed such as Design, DevEx, etc. We see a lot of promising trends and we hope that understanding what engineers and firms are becoming more passionate about that it will help us create a foundation of ideas and knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Realtime memory knowledge updates (RAG updates)</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/earn/realtime-memory-knowledge-updates-rag-updates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/earn/realtime-memory-knowledge-updates-rag-updates/</guid><description> Implement a memory storage system Allow realtime context updates for the LLM Refresh the context and LLM knowledge in realtime Add to cycle fine-tuning</description></item><item><title>Labs Weekly Catchup #3</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/labs/events/labs-weekly-catchup-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/labs/events/labs-weekly-catchup-3/</guid><description>Event Date Discord Channel Type 20/12/2023 üçé apple Internal Our third weekly catchup.

The system automatically constructs a question set based on the candidate&amp;rsquo;s position, such as fresher, mid-level, or senior, to provide relevant questions based on their expertise.</description></item><item><title>Easy Prompt Engineering For Business Use And Mitigating Risks In Llms</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/easy-prompt-engineering-for-business-use-and-mitigating-risks-in-llms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/easy-prompt-engineering-for-business-use-and-mitigating-risks-in-llms/</guid><description>Preface At Dwarves, we&amp;rsquo;ve begun creating apps with ChatGPT for some of our clients. One common problem we face is what techniques of prompt engineering should we use for cases like avoiding political interactions and defending against data leaks. We have been exposed to jailbreaks for ChatGPT such as DAN and Mango Tom, but only recently have figured out how to engineer these kinds of prompts for our research. There are quite a lot of prompt engineering techniques, but below is a collection of common techniques we think you might need the most when creating business apps.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Machine Learning Approaches For Fine Tuning Llama Models</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/exploring-machine-learning-approaches-for-fine-tuning-llama-models/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/exploring-machine-learning-approaches-for-fine-tuning-llama-models/</guid><description>At Dwarves, we&amp;rsquo;ve been increasingly exposed to more state-of-the-art news coming from AI than ever before, of course, related to Large Language Models (LLM). We&amp;rsquo;ve had a taste of what AI has to offer with Stable Diffusion and more commercial apps, and have been eager to learn and hone our skillsets in applying these new AI breakthroughs in our everyday lives and our apps.
Introduction If 2021 was the year of blockchain, it&amp;rsquo;s probably safe to say that 2023 is the year of generative AI.</description></item><item><title>December Forward Engineering 2023</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/forward-engineering-december-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/forward-engineering-december-2023/</guid><description>This month, we have focused on revamping how we learn, familiarize, and work with tech. We are excited to announce that we have updated our Forward Engineering to better reflect the feedback and insights from our Labs team, Operations Team, and Consulting Team.
This is to hopefully provide you with a more comprehensive publication that not only keeps you informed about the latest technologies and where they are applied, but also foster collaboration and innovation within our organization.</description></item></channel></rss>
