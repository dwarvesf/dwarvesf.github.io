It&amp;rsquo;s all around us. Our every movement, every click, is tracked and measured; we quantify the quality of our sleep, how much exercise we get, and how much time we spend looking at our phones.</description></item><item><title>Measuring behaviour changes behaviour</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/measuring-behaviour-changes-behaviour/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/measuring-behaviour-changes-behaviour/</guid><description>Measuring behaviour will provoke change in that behaviour. Something akin to the observer effect takes place: we adjust our behaviour to be &amp;ldquo;seen&amp;rdquo; by the measures.</description></item><item><title>Quant data is lossy</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/quant-data-is-lossy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playground/ux-research/sensemaking/quant-data-is-lossy/</guid><description>Reducing human activity to numbers involves a kind of compression, and a particularly lossy one at that.
