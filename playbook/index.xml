However, from what I understand, democracy is maintained by giving decision-making power to the people. And not just &amp;ldquo;any&amp;rdquo; people. Your people.
We make sure they all feel respected. We all work in the same boat. It&amp;rsquo;s their benefit to care of, too.

Basecamp, for example.
Our path with Basecamp didn&amp;rsquo;t cross by accident. Years ago, we embarked on the Slack community and had it applied for internal communication.

For
example, the token to ether issuance ratio, in a token issuance contract, may be fixed. You can
verify that this is the case at all times with an assert(). Assert guards should often be
combined with other techniques, such as pausing the contract and allowing upgrades. (Otherwise, you

Abstract-vs-interfaces Be aware of the tradeoffs between abstract contracts and interfaces.
Both interfaces and abstract contracts provide one with a customizable and re-usable approach for smart contracts. Interfaces, which were introduced in Solidity 0.4.11, are similar to abstract contracts but cannot have any functions implemented. Interfaces also have limitations such as not being able to access storage or inherit from other interfaces which generally makes abstract contracts more practical.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/precautions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/precautions/</guid><description>As we discussed in the General Philosophy section, it is not enough to protect yourself against the known attacks. Since the cost of failure on a blockchain can be very high, you must also adapt the way you write software, to account for that risk.
The approach we advocate is to &amp;ldquo;prepare for failure&amp;rdquo;. It is impossible to know in advance whether your code is secure. However, you can architect your contracts in a way that allows them to fail gracefully, and with minimal damage.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/token/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/token/</guid><description>Frontrunning The EIP-20 token&amp;rsquo;s approve() function creates the potential for an approved spender to spend more

used, enabling an approved spender to call transferFrom() both before and after the call to
approve() is processed. More details are available on the
EIP, and in

For the front-end, you don&amp;rsquo;t need 100% code coverage, about 70% is probably good enough. Following are some principles:
Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration. Tests should make you more productive not slow you down. Maintaining tests can slow you down. You get dimishing returns on adding more tests after a certain point. Your tests should always resemble the way your software is used.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/git/</guid><description>Source Version Control It&amp;rsquo;s like a time machine.

Just remember to not mess up with the end users. Our responsibility is to keep the system stable with seamless deployment.
Do NOT release on Friday or weekend. We can&amp;rsquo;t handle if any issue happens. The milestone was fully implemented. Git
The PRs contained context and information for tracing back. Git commits message was squashed up.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/restful/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/restful/</guid><description>RESTful API An API is a user interface for developers. Put the effort in to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s not just functional but pleasant to use.
Terminologies The following are the most important terms related to REST APIs.
Resource is an object or representation of something, which has some associated data with it, and there can be a set of methods to operate on it. E.g., Animals, schools, and employees are resources, and delete, add, update are the operations to be performed on these resources.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/security/api-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/security/api-security/</guid><description>API Security Checklist Authentication Consider not using Basic Auth. Use standard authentication (e.g. JWT, OAuth). Don&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel in Authentication, token generation, password storage. Use the standards. Use Max Retry and jail features in Login. Use encryption on all sensitive data. JWT (JSON Web Token) Use a random complicated key (JWT Secret) to make brute forcing the token very hard. Don&amp;rsquo;t extract the algorithm from the payload. Force the algorithm in the backend (HS256 or RS256).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/security/dev-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/security/dev-security/</guid><description>Development Security Checklist TRANSMITING INFORMATION Never send credentials unencrypted over public network. Always use encryption (such as HTTPS, SSL, etc.). Don&amp;rsquo;t accept passwords or session tokens over HTTP. Use HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTPS in the beginning; it&amp;rsquo;s harder to introduce later. Use HTTPS redirects for HTTP traffic. Use HSTS headers to enforce HTTPS
traffic. Use secure cookies. Avoid protocol-relative URLs.

If you list files in the directory, they don‚Äôt show up and keep them safe from the end users. Because of that reason, the developer usually uses it to store configurations of their tools.
Those files are so-called dotfiles. &amp;lsquo;Dotfile&amp;rsquo; become a generalized term for a UNIX configuration file, typically prefixed with a dot (e.g., .vimrc) and found in your home directory.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/setup-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/setup-project/</guid><description>Project Setup Following setup helps us maintain stability and increase the transparency among team members.
Agreement We use GDrive for file storage as specified in our Handbook. As the initiator, you will need to create a subfolder with the project name in the Sales &amp;gt; Agreement folder.
NDA, agreements and all kinds of paperwork between parties will be put there. You can ask the Ops or Business team for help if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the access.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/setup-repository/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/setup-repository/</guid><description>Repository setup How we expect projects to be setup at Dwarves Foundation.

Software is changing the world every day. Software moves fast. The technology you used yesterday may be deprecated today. New technology has enabled us to create new things.
The world is running by the goodwill of people who try to make it a better place. With the existing set of problems, new solutions will come out along with new technologies.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/user-story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/user-story/</guid><description>Agile requirement - User Story What is User Story? In the traditional software development method, requirements are noted as a handful of documentations, specifications&amp;hellip;
In Agile, they are User Story is requirement. User Story is:
A convenient format for expressing the desired business value Crafted in a way that makes them understandable to both business people and technical people Used to provide a great placeholder for a conversation Written at various levels of granularity and are easy to refine Often used with the template:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/versioning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/versioning/</guid><description>Versioning Larger applications consists of multiple components that reference each other and rely on compatibility of the interfaces of the components.
To achieve the goal of loosely coupled applications, each component should be versioned independently hence allowing developers to detect breaking changes or seamless updates just by looking at the version number.
Semantic Versioning SemVer or Semantic Versioning is a way of versioning software in the format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/workflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/workflow/</guid><description>The workflow we chose to adopt is a team agreement on why we should be a team player and how we should act to benefit as a whole, not just an individual.
tl;dr; We apply agile philosophy. A few notes to take before working on a project.
Agile is an adjective, not a fancy word. An agile team is about the team, not the tool. Get to know the team and their capability before making any assumption.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/working-together/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/working-together/</guid><description>Pair Programming We encourage pair programming between all levels of experience. Nobody is required to pair program for a certain amount of time, but it is a great tool to help solve complex problems quickly and more efficiently with an extra set of eyes.
Code that is written by two people who sit next to each other at the same computer is pair-programmed code. The best way to pair program is to just sit side by side in front of the monitor.</description></item></channel></rss>
