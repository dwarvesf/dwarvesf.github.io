Since you last heard from us, we have been going through a lot of changes. There are both good changes and so-so changes. In this update, we are excited to share the real journey of growth and transformation that our team has embarked upon, as we continue to strive to become a more skilled and knowledgable software team.
Shifting focus towards techniques Going full-stack engineering Growing a support system for the community Building stronger bonds through collaboration Nurturing relationships for shared success Shifting focuses towards techniques It’s a bold decision the team has taken.</description></item><item><title>The future is blockchain and data</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/updates/blockchain-and-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/updates/blockchain-and-data/</guid><description>It’s Han and Nikki here,
Plus an extra fresh voice we’re bringing to Dwarves Updates, in hope we can offer you more engineering-related insights and thoughts.
If you’re a part of our Discord server, you probably have noticed #blockchain is our most busy channel. It’s partially because of all the fusses within the crypto scene, but mainly because we’re aggressively learning, experimenting, and evolving on our blockchain expertise.
The data study group is also getting exciting.</description></item><item><title>The stages of hiring at Dwarves</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/updates/hiring-stages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/updates/hiring-stages/</guid><description>Hey,
It’s Han and Nikki, back in your inbox for another Dwarves Updates.
First, we are delighted to share that Dwarves placed top 100 in the Financial Times’ Asia-Pacific High-Growth Company.
When we hustle daily, sometimes we forget to look back and pat ourselves in the back. This achievement serves as a reminder that we’re pretty darn good at what we’re doing.
Huge appreciation to our team, alongside our friends and partners, we’re lucky to have you move along with us.</description></item><item><title>It’s a wrap: 2021 in Review</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/updates/2021-in-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/updates/2021-in-review/</guid><description>Hey, it’s Han and Nikki in your inbox again. On behalf of the entire Dwarves team, happy 2022!
For us 2021 is eventful, and memorable. It was full of changes and challenges, but our can-do mindset made us gritty. While we didn’t have all the answers, we decided to just try and do. As we state in our Agile Minifesto: fail fast, learn often, and it&amp;rsquo;s okay to start over.</description></item><item><title>Engineering organizational structure</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/updates/engineering-org-structure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/updates/engineering-org-structure/</guid><description>Greetings,

Throughout September, we have completed our bi-annual performance review.
How we approach engineer performance review We all have our fair share of performance reviews, be it reviewing others or being reviewed.</description></item><item><title>Project Compliance</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/updates/project-compliance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/updates/project-compliance/</guid><description>Hey,
It&amp;rsquo;s Han &amp;amp; Nikki from Team Dwarves. This email is the third month we share about our journey to Software Craftsmanship. The last two issues were in June and July. And we received quite a little feedback from our friends and past clients. Thanks for supporting.
This month, we share about how we do project delivery compliance.
How we do compliance If there&amp;rsquo;s something that we try to minimize at all costs, it&amp;rsquo;s risks.</description></item><item><title>Da Lat Office</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/updates/dalat-office/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/updates/dalat-office/</guid><description>Hey,

This month the Dwarves score 40th client that we have the honor to serve. And for that, we decide to launch the Dwarves Updates.
As we build this company like we build a product, when we think about this approach, we ask different questions: Do people work here know how to use the company? Is it simple? Is it obvious how it works?</description></item></channel></rss>
