A devcontainer.json file in your project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase. Workspace files are mounted from the local file system or copied or cloned into the container.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/create-working-devcontainer-for-nextjs-boilerplate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/create-working-devcontainer-for-nextjs-boilerplate/</guid><description>https://github.com/dwarvesf/nextjs-boilerplate/pull/40

Our adventure until now has been incredibly thrilling, with a strong focus on &amp;lsquo;LLM in Production.&amp;rsquo; Now, we shift our attention to a topic that is always important and never outdated: Fullstack Engineering.
In a world where new businesses and product teams are always changing, there is a high demand for engineers who are skilled in many areas and can handle both sides of the development process.</description></item><item><title>Our View On Fullstack Engineering</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/our-view-on-fullstack-engineering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/our-view-on-fullstack-engineering/</guid><description>In tackling challenges in the world of software development, the term &amp;ldquo;full-stack engineer&amp;rdquo; often evokes a sense of wonder. I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of my school days when our chemistry teacher explained the fundamental principles behind chemical reactions. Just as every chemical reaction is governed by the behavior of atoms, there&amp;rsquo;s an underlying principle in software development that defines full-stack engineering.
At its core, full-stack engineering is more than just a developer who works on both the backend and frontend.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/building-reliable-apps-sentry-and-distributed-tracing-for-effective-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/building-reliable-apps-sentry-and-distributed-tracing-for-effective-monitoring/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/an-engineering-story-map-for-llms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/an-engineering-story-map-for-llms/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/exploring-resumable-server-side-rendering-with-qwik/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/exploring-resumable-server-side-rendering-with-qwik/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/radio-talk-65-fullstack-type-safe-with-trpc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/radar/timeline/radio-talk-65-fullstack-type-safe-with-trpc/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Type Safe Framework</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/earn/type-safe-framework/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/earn/type-safe-framework/</guid><description>Background Developers working on Javascript Applications often face the challenge of enforcing type safety between the client and server. One effective solution is to automatically generate an OpenAPI Spec file from server code. This can then be used with the OpenAPI generator to produce a client-side library for making typesafe API calls to the backend. Our existing workflow has adopted the typesafe approach using Swagger for API documentation. We aim to upgrade this approach by automating the generation of API methods.</description></item><item><title>Trend Command</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/earn/trend-command/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/earn/trend-command/</guid><description>Requirements ?trend command The idea is to create a ?trend Discord command that will list the top 15 trending repositories on GitHub.
We can reference https://github.com/trending to make our list. Otherwise, we will need to identify what should count as trending on our end (stars/day, commits/day, etc).
There are no particular design requirements for this command, but it should use an embed and look similar to the outputs of our other commands.</description></item><item><title>Cimb Dwarves X Netizen Initiating A Digital Wealth Management Experience</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/cimb-dwarves-x-netizen-initiating-a-digital-wealth-management-experience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/cimb-dwarves-x-netizen-initiating-a-digital-wealth-management-experience/</guid><description>Industry

RLHF is a part of the training process that involves fine-tuning a language model using human feedback to make it more efficient and customer-appropriate. It is particularly useful in controlling and improving the responses of chatbot models.
What’s better about this method or library Technical Creativity: RLHF represents a creative approach that enhances the capabilities of NLP models by incorporating human feedback, which is often more intuitive and context-aware.</description></item><item><title>Life At Dwarves Software Design Group</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/life-at-dwarves-software-design-group/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/life-at-dwarves-software-design-group/</guid><description>The idea: A path to better software “Everything in software architecture is a trade-off, and the why is more important than how.&amp;quot; Neal Ford is a Director and software architect at ThoughtWorks

One common problem we face is what techniques of prompt engineering should we use for cases like avoiding political interactions and defending against data leaks. We have been exposed to jailbreaks for ChatGPT such as DAN and Mango Tom, but only recently have figured out how to engineer these kinds of prompts for our research. There are quite a lot of prompt engineering techniques, but below is a collection of common techniques we think you might need the most when creating business apps.</description></item><item><title>Forward Engineering May 2023</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/forward-engineering-may-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/forward-engineering-may-2023/</guid><description>The technological landscape is vast, brimming with opportunities for exploration and growth.

Some of us had built a game, while others were familiar with e-commerce platforms, D-apps, or even all of these types of applications, and more. Each type of software that we were working on needed different techniques, some of which were similar. So the same problem can happen in every software product.

CI stands for continuous integration. It involves linting, testing, building, and merging developers&amp;rsquo; various code changes into a shared repository such as GitHub, Gitlab, or pushing software images to a container registry, usually multiple times per day.
On the other hand, CD refers to either continuous delivery or continuous deployment, which are sometimes used interchangeably.

When an industry begins this journey of digital transformation depends largely on the specific nature of its offering. As a rule of thumb, the more product-oriented and direct-to-customer an industry is, the sooner its digital transformation journey begins. The first important question is: why do industries go through this transformation process? What is the overall purpose? One common misconception is that fear is a major driver of transformation - the fear of being disrupted, the fear of becoming obsolete, the fear of losing out.</description></item><item><title>Dwarves Tech Radar Volume 01</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/dwarves-tech-radar-volume-01/</guid><description>The Dwarves have their tradition to explore the tech scene and learn new things.

The software community has been hungering for a small, simple, easy-to-learn and pragmatic programming language. Go fits the bill with:
Simplicity Go&amp;rsquo;s beauty lies in its powerful simplicity. A list of NO&amp;rsquo;s in Go design contains generics, ternary operation, pointer arithmetic,…. These features are missing because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit, and it affects compilation speed, and end up making the language too complicated.</description></item><item><title>A Tips Of Hiring Dont</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/a-tips-of-hiring-dont/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/a-tips-of-hiring-dont/</guid><description>Many companies out there get lured by the vision of &amp;ldquo;scaling up&amp;rdquo;.

Hire without plan bored talent people out. There&amp;rsquo;s no good to put people in a place where they can&amp;rsquo;t create any impact. And we?

As a result two different strategies for pricing services, such as building software, have traditionally been used by most companies. These are called “Fixed Price” and “Time And Materials”.

Innovation happens but not many people can point out clearly. Getting to know the foundation of innovation helps understanding its natures and could lead to further exploration. Enjoy your reading.
Innovation deepens our knowledge and understanding of the world, it extends our reach and access to resources. More importantly, innovation expands the realm of what we can do with all our knowledge and resources: deliver new goods and products, bring forward new types of organisations and services, and in more general terms develop new ideas and concepts.</description></item><item><title>Aarrr Framework In A Nutshell</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/aarrr-framework-in-a-nutshell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/aarrr-framework-in-a-nutshell/</guid><description>We could find a bunch of AARRR frameworks definition across the internet (Thanks to Google).

So why delegating? At least, in business, delegation means having extra people to help distribute the stress, provides a gathered source of information, and a couple of extra hands to slap when our thought goes wrong. Delegation also gives delegator more time &amp;amp; effort to focus on other things, or sometimes just a perfect excuse to grab a beer instead of burying their heads in the sand.</description></item><item><title>Constructive Feedback</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/constructive-feedback/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/constructive-feedback/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s in human nature to instantly lose their mind when things get hard, and somehow they split nasty things that can&amp;rsquo;t be undone.

Traditional Deployment Era Early on, organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to define resource boundaries for applications in a physical server, and this caused resource allocation issues. For example, if multiple applications run on a physical server, there can be instances where one application would take up most of the resources, and as a result, the other applications would underperform.</description></item><item><title>Traits To Assess During An Interview</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/traits-to-assess-during-an-interview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/traits-to-assess-during-an-interview/</guid><description>GRIT: Look for a time the candidate wanted something so badly, they were unstoppable in pursuing it.

A broker component is responsible for coordinating communication, such as forwarding requests, as well as for transmitting results and exceptions.
Component Clients: implements user functionality, send requests to server through a client-side proxy Server: Implements services, registers itself with the local broker, send responses and exceptions back the client through a server-side proxy Broker(a messenger that is responsible for the transmission of requests from clients to servers): registers server, offers interface(APIs, &amp;hellip;), transfer messages, error recovery, interoperates with other brokers through bridges, locates servers Client-side proxy(a layer between clients and the broker): encapsulates system-specific functionality, mediates between the client and the broker Server-side proxy: calls services within the server, encapsulates system-specific functionality, mediates between server and the broker Bridge( responsible for communication among brokers): encapsulates network-specific functionality, mediates between the local broker and the bridge of a remote broker The role of Broker Patter Our system need to be dynamically removing or adding new agent(server, client) The agents in our system need the ability to be independent of each other( scalable, partition functionality into independent agents) The ability of Broker Pattern In the decoupled behavior, Broker acts like an interface, when a new server was adding on the system, it just like add a new object, and the only thing we need to do is to register the new server with Broker.</description></item><item><title>Using Correct Html Element To Increase Website Accessibility</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/using-correct-html-element-to-increase-website-accessibility/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/using-correct-html-element-to-increase-website-accessibility/</guid><description>Website Accessibility Website Accessibility is a term for approaching a website of which the potential user are people with disabilities (eye disorders or illiterate).

For new nodes (e.g. by domestic users like me), we tend to choose the official/reputated nodes (e.g. nodes at SDF/IBM) to trust / to be the validators in our Quorum.</description></item><item><title>Fabric Hyperledger Architecture Explanation</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/memo/fabric-hyperledger-architecture-explanation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/memo/fabric-hyperledger-architecture-explanation/</guid><description>What is Hyperledger Hyperledger is an open source community focused on developing a suite of stable frameworks, tools and libraries for enterprise-grade blockchain deployments.

Abstract-vs-interfaces Be aware of the tradeoffs between abstract contracts and interfaces.
Both interfaces and abstract contracts provide one with a customizable and re-usable approach for smart contracts. Interfaces, which were introduced in Solidity 0.4.11, are similar to abstract contracts but cannot have any functions implemented. Interfaces also have limitations such as not being able to access storage or inherit from other interfaces which generally makes abstract contracts more practical.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/precautions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/precautions/</guid><description>As we discussed in the General Philosophy section, it is not enough to protect yourself against the known attacks. Since the cost of failure on a blockchain can be very high, you must also adapt the way you write software, to account for that risk.
The approach we advocate is to &amp;ldquo;prepare for failure&amp;rdquo;. It is impossible to know in advance whether your code is secure. However, you can architect your contracts in a way that allows them to fail gracefully, and with minimal damage.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/token/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/token/</guid><description>Frontrunning The EIP-20 token&amp;rsquo;s approve() function creates the potential for an approved spender to spend more
than the intended amount. A
front running attack can be
used, enabling an approved spender to call transferFrom() both before and after the call to
approve() is processed. More details are available on the
EIP, and in

Standardization Generally speaking, smart contracts of tokens should follow an accepted and stable standard.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/changelog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/changelog/</guid><description>Writing a useful changelog Remember the last time you read over the changelog of your favorite app and found it sucks with useless information like they don&amp;rsquo;t care about the product that they sell out.

Every project member must have another team member or team leader to review his/her code, and every changes to the code must be achieved via a Pull request to the main development branch.

For the front-end, you don&amp;rsquo;t need 100% code coverage, about 70% is probably good enough. Following are some principles:
Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration. Tests should make you more productive not slow you down. Maintaining tests can slow you down. You get dimishing returns on adding more tests after a certain point. Your tests should always resemble the way your software is used.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/git/</guid><description>Source Version Control It&amp;rsquo;s like a time machine.
