Innovation deepens our knowledge and understanding of the world, it extends our reach and access to resources.

So why delegating? At least, in business, delegation means having extra people to help distribute the stress, provides a gathered source of information, and a couple of extra hands to slap when our thought goes wrong.

No, burn-out isn&amp;rsquo;t stress.
It describes the state of physical and emotional exhaustion. Burnout reduces and sucks out your productivity. As it develops, it beats every single reason that once was your working motto. The interest, the creativity and motivation gets faded away.

Object : is a goal we want to achieve
**Key Results : **are a set of explaination for how will we know we are getting there.
For example
In Q1/2018 DF&amp;rsquo;s objective is want to build a strong backend team, so &amp;ldquo;**build a strong backend team&amp;rdquo; **is an object, to accomplish that, we will hire 2 senior backend developers and **organize 1 training session per week, **each of them is a key result to let us know whether we are getting to our objective or not.</description></item><item><title>Our Metrics For Performance Review</title><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/operations/our-metrics-for-performance-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/operations/our-metrics-for-performance-review/</guid><description>$$ P = f(r, t, c, r) $$

combined with other techniques, such as pausing the contract and allowing upgrades. (Otherwise, you

Abstract-vs-interfaces Be aware of the tradeoffs between abstract contracts and interfaces.
Both interfaces and abstract contracts provide one with a customizable and re-usable approach for smart contracts. Interfaces, which were introduced in Solidity 0.4.11, are similar to abstract contracts but cannot have any functions implemented. Interfaces also have limitations such as not being able to access storage or inherit from other interfaces which generally makes abstract contracts more practical.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/precautions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/precautions/</guid><description>As we discussed in the General Philosophy section, it is not enough to protect yourself against the known attacks. Since the cost of failure on a blockchain can be very high, you must also adapt the way you write software, to account for that risk.
The approach we advocate is to &amp;ldquo;prepare for failure&amp;rdquo;. It is impossible to know in advance whether your code is secure. However, you can architect your contracts in a way that allows them to fail gracefully, and with minimal damage.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/token/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/token/</guid><description>Frontrunning The EIP-20 token&amp;rsquo;s approve() function creates the potential for an approved spender to spend more
than the intended amount. A
front running attack can be
used, enabling an approved spender to call transferFrom() both before and after the call to
approve() is processed. More details are available on the
EIP, and in
this document.
Standardization Generally speaking, smart contracts of tokens should follow an accepted and stable standard.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/changelog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/changelog/</guid><description>Writing a useful changelog Remember the last time you read over the changelog of your favorite app and found it sucks with useless information like they don&amp;rsquo;t care about the product that they sell out.

Code should be functional in style rather than Object Orientated or Imperative unless there are no clean alternatives.
Use pure functions where possible to make them testable and modular.

For the front-end, you don&amp;rsquo;t need 100% code coverage, about 70% is probably good enough. Following are some principles:
Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration. Tests should make you more productive not slow you down. Maintaining tests can slow you down. You get dimishing returns on adding more tests after a certain point. Your tests should always resemble the way your software is used.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://memo.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/git/</guid><description>Source Version Control It&amp;rsquo;s like a time machine. We can save and reload anytime we want to, like in the old day of Game Boy Advance. We can work in parallel universes of our source code, experimenting without fear of losing work, and rolling back if something goes wrong.
We use git. Git is one of the most popular distributed source version control.

When a new person joins a project, project members are changed, or project is moved to another team, a

Why? Reduce handover time. Make clear for everyone how handover will affect schedules/communication/budget. Reduce risks of post-handover work. Ensure good confidence for new members.
