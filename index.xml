One effective solution is to automatically generate an OpenAPI Spec file from server code. This can then be used with the OpenAPI generator to produce a client-side library for making typesafe API calls to the backend. Our existing workflow has adopted the typesafe approach using Swagger for API documentation. We aim to upgrade this approach by automating the generation of API methods.</description></item><item><title>?trend command</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/earn/trend-command/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/earn/trend-command/</guid><description>Requirements ?trend command The idea is to create a ?trend Discord command that will list the top 15 trending repositories on GitHub.
We can reference https://github.com/trending to make our list. Otherwise, we will need to identify what should count as trending on our end (stars/day, commits/day, etc).
There are no particular design requirements for this command, but it should use an embed and look similar to the outputs of our other commands.</description></item><item><title>A webpage showing where the Dwarves from</title><link>https://note.d.foundation/earn/dwarvesf-map/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/earn/dwarvesf-map/</guid><description>👀 Imagine having a map flexing dwarves all around the globe

Abstract-vs-interfaces Be aware of the tradeoffs between abstract contracts and interfaces. Both interfaces and abstract contracts provide one with a customizable and re-usable approach for smart contracts. Interfaces, which were introduced in Solidity 0.4.11, are similar to abstract contracts but cannot have any functions implemented. Interfaces also have limitations such as not being able to access storage or inherit from other interfaces which generally makes abstract contracts more practical.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/precautions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/precautions/</guid><description>As we discussed in the General Philosophy section, it is not enough to protect yourself against the known attacks. Since the cost of failure on a blockchain can be very high, you must also adapt the way you write software, to account for that risk.
The approach we advocate is to &amp;ldquo;prepare for failure&amp;rdquo;. It is impossible to know in advance whether your code is secure. However, you can architect your contracts in a way that allows them to fail gracefully, and with minimal damage.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/token/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/blockchain/token/</guid><description>Frontrunning The EIP-20 token&amp;rsquo;s approve() function creates the potential for an approved spender to spend more than the intended amount. A front running attack can be used, enabling an approved spender to call transferFrom() both before and after the call to approve() is processed. More details are available on the EIP, and in this document.
Standardization Generally speaking, smart contracts of tokens should follow an accepted and stable standard.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/changelog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/changelog/</guid><description>Writing a useful changelog Remember the last time you read over the changelog of your favorite app and found it sucks with useless information like they don&amp;rsquo;t care about the product that they sell out.

Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.
One of the key benefits of integrating regularly is that you can detect errors quickly and locate them more easily.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/code-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/code-review/</guid><description>Code Review How we do code review at Dwarves Foundation.
Every project member must have another team member or team leader to review his/her code, and every changes to the code must be achieved via a Pull request to the main development branch. On larger project (10 developers+) we may requires 2 reviewers. All of this is to ensure correctness, quality of the code and learning opportunities for both assignee (who develop) and reviewer.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/db-migration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/db-migration/</guid><description>Database migration Mobile macOS / iOS:

For the front-end, you don&amp;rsquo;t need 100% code coverage, about 70% is probably good enough. Following are some principles:
Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration. Tests should make you more productive not slow you down. Maintaining tests can slow you down. You get dimishing returns on adding more tests after a certain point. Your tests should always resemble the way your software is used.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>han@d.foundation (Han Ngo)</author><guid>https://note.d.foundation/playbook/engineering/git/</guid><description>Source Version Control It&amp;rsquo;s like a time machine.
