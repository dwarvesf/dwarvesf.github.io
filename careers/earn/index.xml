We can reference https://github.com/trending to make our list. Otherwise, we will need to identify what should count as trending on our end (stars/day, commits/day, etc).
There are no particular design requirements for this command, but it should use an embed and look similar to the outputs of our other commands.</description></item></channel></rss>
